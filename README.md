Some fun in C and Python (standard algorithms and data structures)

In an attempt to just practice implementing algorithms and data structure with which I am familiar, but likely haven't implemented in 
a sufficiently long time, I've created this repository to hold them as examples.

# Planned algorithms
* sorting
  * merge sort
  * heap sort(?maybe)
  * insertion sort
  * quicksort (randomized quicksort forces average runtime ``O(n*logn)`` instead of ``O(n**2)`` 
* trees
  * breadth first search
  * depth first search
  * also how to represent them and why
  * minimum spanning trees (yay, greedy)

# Data structures
* trees
  * binary search tree
  * red-black tree
  * B-variant tree
* lists
  * linked lists are fun (maybe doubly, maybe skipped)
* ...

# Study
* need to review network flow
* need to review hardware requirements
