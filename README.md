Some fun in C and Python (standard algorithms and data structures)

In an attempt to just practice implementing algorithms and data structure with which I am familiar, but likely haven't implemented in 
a sufficiently long time, I've created this repository to hold them as examples.

# Planned algorithms:
* sorting
  * merge sort
  * heap sort(?maybe)
  * insertion sort
  * quick sort
* trees
  * breadth first search
  * depth first search

# Data structures:
* trees
  * binary search tree
  * red-black tree
  * B-variant tree
* lists
  * linked lists are fun (maybe doubly, maybe skipped)
* ...
