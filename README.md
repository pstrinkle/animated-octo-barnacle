Some fun in C and Python (standard algorithms and data structures)

In an attempt to just practice implementing algorithms and data structure with which I am familiar, but likely haven't implemented in 
a sufficiently long time, I've created this repository to hold them as examples.

Planned algorithms:
# sorting
## merge sort
## heap sort
## insertion sort
## quick sort
# trees
# breadth first search
# depth first search

Data structures:
# binary search tree
# red-black tree
# B-variant tree
# ...
